- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marinos, im 33 years old and i live in the lovely island of Cyprus
- ðŸ‘€ I used to work in a Casino for a couple of years before leaving my job and transitioning into Data Analytics, Coding and Machine Learning. I enjoy the sun, beach and pushing myself in the gym.
- ðŸŒ± I love working with Python and SQL and even tho i wish i done this sooner, im greatefull to be doing it now. Currently working on a React-native mobile app which also and i find it both very challanging and fun.
- Since i just started in all of this last year, the projects here are not that good, i know , but i want to keep them for now as a reference of my improvement for when the new projects are added.
- ðŸ“« Would love to meet and work on projects with new people so hit me up... Cheers :)
